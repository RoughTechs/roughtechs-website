    <h2>Advertising & Tracking</h2>

    <h2>Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to collect crash logs and performance data to diagnose and resolve issues. This data is not used for advertising.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your account and game data are stored securely in <strong>Supabase</strong> (a cloud database service) using industry-standard security practices.</p>
